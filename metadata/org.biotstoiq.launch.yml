Description: |-
  <b>NOTE:</b> App repo is archived by dev. It is read-only for all users and it is no longer activelyÂ maintained.

  <b>launch is a fast, productive and easy-to-use launcher for android</b>

  features
  --------
  * launch apps instantly with patterns: as fast as your typing allows you to
  be
  * assign long-press shortcuts to quickly access apps.
  * easy on eyes
  * no icons, distractions, clutter/bloat, etc
  * lightweight and efficient
  * not just visual minimalism like most other minimalist launchers,
  but technical minimalism too.
  * open-source
  * uses at least ~10x less space than even the *minimalist* launchers

  functions
  ---------
  * use search keys to create a filter word which shows only the filtered apps
  * click on an app to launch it
  * long-press on an app to launch it's system settings
  * press back button to clear the last character of the search word
  * long-press on the back button to refresh the app list (to reflect
  deletion/addition of apps)
  * long-press on a search key to launch/assign a shortcut app.

  how does it work
  ----------------
  * keys on the left and right side are for searching, and the middle section
  shows the apps installed
  * start searching by using the search keys
  * if the search word only has one final matching app in the list, it will
  be opened automatically
  * to quickly launch an app, find a unique combination of alphabets
  which can launch it. for example, if "K-9 Mail" is the only app which has
  a "9" in it in my app list, then it can be launched just by pressing
  the "9" search key
  * assign an app to a search key by long-pressing on the search key. this
  assignment can be removed and/or modified.

  goals
  -----
  * launch aims for the following:
  * maximum compatibility (supports android >=5.0)
  * do more with less
  * ethical correctness (no ads/trackers)
  * stick to the UNIX philosophy (do one thing and do it well)
