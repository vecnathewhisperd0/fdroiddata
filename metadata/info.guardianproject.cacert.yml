Summary: Disable untrusted certificates
Description: |-
  Android 4+ allows you to disable certificates from the system Settings and root
  isn't required, so try that first if you want to manually mess with the
  certificates. The app won't work with Android 4+ anyway.

  An app to manage security certificates on your phone also containing a version
  of the Android CACert keystore derived from Mozilla. If a certificate has
  recently become untrusted you can either install an update to this app or you
  can backup and remove certificates by yourself.

  Requires root: Yes, it writes to the system partition. You will need a device
  that has the ‘grep' command on it (via busybox: present on most custom ROMs). If
  the ‘save' doesn't work, then you will need to make your /system partition
  read-write by using a file explorer like https://f-droid.org/packages/com.ghostsq.commander or via a
  command in https://f-droid.org/packages/jackpal.androidterm.
