MaintainerNotes: |-
  Thunderbird for Android is based on K-9 Mail. The source repository contains both applications, a
  symlink points to the correct metadata path. We're using the `foss` flavor for submission to
  f-droid, while the `full` flavor will be reserved for the Play Store.

  Thunderbird on the Play Store has two separate application ids and listings. For f-droid, we're
  likely going to do the beta releases via our own app repository.

  The source code may have a few pointers to potentially unwanted features. There is the Play Store
  billing library, which we're going to use to collect financial contributions in the Play Store
  flavor. The f-droid variant simply links out to our fundraising page in a web browser. There is
  also Glean telemetry, which is currently disabled. When we re-enable it, we expect it will meet
  the opt-in requirements set in the policies.

  We're looking to make reproducible builds work, which may take a little time to work out. As we
  don't want to wait until the release to begin, the pull request associated with this package will
  first point to net.thunderbird.android.beta. When everything works, we'll switch over to
  net.thunderbird.android for inclusion in f-droid.
