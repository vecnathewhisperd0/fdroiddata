Lightweight pedometer using the hardware step-sensor for minimal battery
consumption. This app is designed to be kept running all the time without having
any impact on your battery life! It uses the hardware step detection sensor of
the Nexus 5, which is already running even when not using any pedometer app.
Therefore the app does not drain any additional battery. Unlike other pedometer
apps, this app does not track your movement or your location so it doesn't need
to turn on your GPS sensor (again: no impact on your battery).
