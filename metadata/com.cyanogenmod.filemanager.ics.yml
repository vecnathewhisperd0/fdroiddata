  <b>NOTE:</b> This app is no longer maintained, its repo was deleted.

  A backport of the CyanogenMod File Manager application to ICS and higher. This
  is an unofficial fork of the main CyanogenMod File Manager project.

  changed by choosing a different security access mode in the General preferences.
  Then root will be called for if you try to change something that normally can't
  be.
