Description: |-
  This is a simple open source battery calibration app which needs super user
  rights.

  <b>How does it calibrate your battery?</b> The app resets your fuel gauge and the
  batterystats.bin file.

  <b>Why is superuser required?</b> To reset the fuel gauge it has to write into a
  /sys/class/ file. This is not possible without superuser permission.
