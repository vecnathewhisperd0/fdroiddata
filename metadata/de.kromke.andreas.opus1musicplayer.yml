AutoName: Opus 1 Music Player
Description: |-
    Advanced player and management application, especially designed
    for classical music. Instead of "Artists" and "Songs" in pop(ular) music, this program uses the
    metadata composer and grouping to organise the music in works (e.g. a symphony)
    consisting of movements (parts of this work). The music collection can be
    queried using filters and text search for composer, genre, work, performer, etc..

    This program can be seen as a sophisticated feature upgrade to the Unpopular Music Player.
