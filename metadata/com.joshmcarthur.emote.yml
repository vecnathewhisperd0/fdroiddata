Summary: Emotional check-ins for positive mental health
Description: |-
    Emote is a simple tool for maintaining a record of emotions throughout
    your day. Over time, keeping such a log can help to identify trends and
    triggers that cause emotions that may affect your overall mental health.

    Permissions are kept to an absolute minimum, and all data is securely
    stored locally on your device. There is no outbound internet permissions
    requested, and notifications are set up and triggered locally, not using
    a cloud service.

    To help maintain a history of your Emote checkins, this app is compatible
    with the Android backup service - if enabled, your Emote checkins will
    be backed up along with the rest of your application data.
